It's a very exciting time for innovation in this sector.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, there are *constant* and exciting new developments in drug discovery driven by AI. The field is moving incredibly fast. Here are some of the key areas and recent trends:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **Designing novel molecules from scratch:** This is a major breakthrough. Instead of screening vast libraries of existing compounds, generative AI models (like those based on GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models) can be trained on chemical structures and properties. They can then \"invent\" entirely new molecules with desired characteristics – such as binding affinity to a specific target, solubility, or low toxicity.\n*   **\"De novo\" drug design:** This is the term often used. AI can explore chemical space much more broadly and efficiently than traditional methods, potentially uncovering drug candidates that human chemists might not have conceived.\n*   **Examples:** Companies are using this to design potential treatments for a wide range of diseases, from cancer to neurological disorders.\n\n**2. Advanced Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Uncovering new biological targets:** AI is being used to analyze massive datasets from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and clinical records to identify previously unknown proteins or pathways that play a crucial role in disease.\n*   **Understanding disease mechanisms:** By sifting through complex biological interactions, AI can help researchers gain deeper insights into the underlying causes of diseases, which then informs drug target selection.\n*   **Multi-omics integration:** AI excels at integrating diverse biological data types to create a more holistic picture of disease biology.\n\n**3. Accelerating Pre-clinical and Clinical Trials:**\n\n*   **Predicting drug efficacy and toxicity:** AI models can analyze preclinical data (e.g., cell assays, animal models) and even early clinical data to predict how a drug might perform in later stages or identify potential safety issues sooner.\n*   **Optimizing clinical trial design:** AI can help identify the most suitable patient populations for trials, predict patient response rates, and even suggest optimal dosing regimens, making trials more efficient and cost-effective.\n*   **Repurposing existing drugs:** AI can scan through existing approved drugs and identify potential new uses for them against different diseases by analyzing their molecular targets and known effects.\n\n**4. AI-Powered Synthesis and Manufacturing:**\n\n*   **Predicting chemical reactions:** AI can help predict the feasibility and optimal conditions for synthesizing complex drug molecules, streamlining the lab work for chemists.\n*   **Optimizing manufacturing processes:** AI can be applied to improve the efficiency and yield of drug manufacturing, reducing costs and waste.\n\n**5. Focus on Undruggable Targets:**\n\n*   **New approaches to challenging proteins:** Many diseases involve proteins that have historically been difficult to target with traditional drugs (e.g., certain transcription factors or protein-protein interactions). AI is enabling new strategies to design molecules that can modulate these \"undruggable\" targets.\n\n**Recent News and Trends to Watch For:**\n\n*   **Partnerships between AI drug discovery companies and large pharmaceutical companies:** This is a strong indicator of the maturity and promise of AI in this sector. Many big pharma companies are investing heavily in or partnering with AI-first biotech firms.\n*   **AI-discovered drugs entering clinical trials:** We are starting to see more drugs that were discovered and designed using AI move into human testing, which is a critical milestone.\n*   **Advancements in explainable AI (XAI) for drug discovery:** As AI becomes more integral, there's a growing need for researchers to understand *why* an AI model made a particular prediction or designed a specific molecule. This builds trust and allows for scientific validation.\n*   **The impact of Large Language Models (LLMs):** While not directly designing molecules, LLMs are being used to sift through vast amounts of scientific literature, identify trends, summarize research, and even help write research papers related to drug discovery.\n\n**Key Players and Areas of Focus:**\n\nCompanies like **Recursion Pharmaceuticals**, **Insilico Medicine**, **Atomwise**, **Exscientia**, **BenevolentAI**, and **DeepMind's AlphaFold** (while not directly a drug discovery platform, its protein structure prediction has profound implications) are consistently in the news for their contributions.\n\nIn summary, AI is not just an incremental improvement in drug discovery; it's fundamentally changing the process, making it faster, more efficient, and capable of exploring entirely new therapeutic avenues.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned: **Advanced Target Identification**.\n\nThis area is crucial because before you can even *think* about designing a drug, you need to know *what* to target within the body. For decades, drug discovery relied on a somewhat serendipitous or hypothesis-driven approach to finding these targets. AI is making this process far more systematic, data-driven, and comprehensive.\n\nHere's a deeper dive into what \"Advanced Target Identification\" with AI entails:\n\n**1. The Challenge of Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Disease complexity:** Many diseases are not caused by a single malfunctioning component but by intricate networks of interactions within cells and the body. Pinpointing the *key driver* or the *most effective intervention point* is difficult.\n*   **Vast biological data:** The amount of biological data generated today is staggering – from human genome sequencing, gene expression studies (transcriptomics), protein levels (proteomics), metabolites (metabolomics), and detailed patient health records. It's impossible for humans to manually sift through and connect all this information to identify meaningful targets.\n*   **\"Undruggable\" targets:** As mentioned earlier, some disease-causing proteins have proven extremely difficult to design drugs for using traditional methods. AI can help identify them and potentially also suggest novel ways to interact with them.\n\n**2. How AI Enhances Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Pattern Recognition in Big Data:** AI algorithms, particularly machine learning, are exceptional at identifying subtle patterns and correlations within massive, multi-dimensional datasets that human researchers might miss.\n    *   **Genomics:** AI can analyze genomic variations associated with diseases, linking specific genes to altered protein function and disease states.\n    *   **Transcriptomics (RNA sequencing):** AI can identify genes that are abnormally \"turned on\" or \"off\" in diseased cells compared to healthy ones, pointing to critical pathways.\n    *   **Proteomics:** AI can identify proteins that are over- or under-expressed in disease, or proteins that are interacting in ways that contribute to pathology.\n    *   **Electronic Health Records (EHRs):** AI can analyze patient histories, diagnoses, treatments, and outcomes to identify biomarkers or patient subgroups associated with specific diseases.\n\n*   **Network Biology and Systems Thinking:** Instead of looking at individual genes or proteins in isolation, AI can build and analyze complex biological networks.\n    *   **Identifying bottlenecks or crucial nodes:** AI can help identify the \"linchpin\" proteins or pathways within a disease network that, if modulated, would have the most significant impact on the disease progression.\n    *   **Understanding disease pathways:** AI can map out the chain reactions and interactions that lead to disease, revealing new points of intervention.\n\n*   **Predictive Modeling:**\n    *   **Predicting disease progression:** AI can build models to predict how a disease will progress in a patient based on their molecular profile, helping to prioritize targets for early intervention.\n    *   **Predicting drug response:** AI can identify targets that, when modulated, are most likely to elicit a positive therapeutic response in a specific patient population.\n\n*   **Integration of Diverse Data Sources (Multi-omics):** The real power comes from AI's ability to integrate data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, imaging, and clinical data simultaneously. This provides a far richer and more accurate picture of disease than any single data type alone.\n\n**3. Examples and Applications:**\n\n*   **Identifying novel cancer targets:** AI has been used to identify specific mutations or protein expressions in tumors that are driving growth and can be targeted with new therapies.\n*   **Neurological diseases:** AI can help unravel the complex genetic and molecular underpinnings of diseases like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, identifying new therapeutic targets.\n*   **Infectious diseases:** AI can analyze the genetic makeup of pathogens and host responses to identify vulnerabilities or targets for antiviral or antibacterial drugs.\n\n**4. The Impact:**\n\n*   **Faster Identification:** AI significantly accelerates the time it takes to go from a large dataset to a list of promising drug targets.\n*   **Higher Quality Targets:** By analyzing more data and complex relationships, AI can identify targets that are more likely to be validated and lead to successful drugs, reducing attrition rates in later stages.\n*   **Uncovering Novel Biology:** AI can shine a light on previously unknown biological mechanisms and pathways involved in disease, opening up entirely new avenues for therapeutic development.\n\nIn essence, AI transforms target identification from a painstaking, often educated-guess process into a systematic, data-driven discovery engine. It's about using computational power to make sense of the overwhelming complexity of biology to find the right keys to unlock disease treatments.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven target identification is dynamic and includes a mix of:\n\n*   **AI-first Drug Discovery Platforms:** These companies were founded with AI at their core and are focused on building proprietary AI engines to discover targets and drugs.\n*   **Biotechnology Companies:** Many biotech firms are integrating AI into their existing R&D pipelines, often focusing on specific disease areas or modalities.\n*   **Large Pharmaceutical Companies:** Big Pharma is increasingly investing in, acquiring, or partnering with AI companies to leverage their capabilities.\n*   **Academic Institutions & Spin-offs:** Leading universities are hubs for AI and bioinformatics research, often spawning startups.\n\nHere are some of the main companies and types of entities that are prominent in AI-driven target identification:\n\n**1.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
